Typical corporate networks have multiple access points on the network. The security of these points is ensured by encryption and firewall, but today's types of attacks are insufficient by themselves. Therefore, intrusion detection and prevention systems are used in addition to these technologies.
Intrusion detection systems monitor the network, record network traffic, stop threats, and report this to the security administrator. Intrusion detection and prevention systems are required in many safety structures. Because attackers can stop trying to gather information about your network.
IDS is a warning system that reports unauthorized access. IPS is the system that implements the defense strategy to detect a warning situation. We can't think of IPS alone. IPS is a branch of IDS. Because we cannot prevent the attack without detecting it.
